<p>A study of the Raik Road area in Aberdeen looking at its development since the end of the Ice Age through the lens of <i>metabolic animism</i>. This looks at the area as a site of metabolic flows and processes considering how the land and human and more-than-human lifeforms shape and are shaped within these. Natural resources, labour and culture act upon one another. This is seen most typically in relation to changing forms of food production but also in areas such as the oil industry.</p><p>The project consisted of an <a href="https://worm.gallery/showing/simon-yuil-raik">exhibition</a>, public workshops and publication.</p>

<p><i>Stackwalker</i> is a collection of interviews collected over a period  from August 2008 to June 2010. Most were recorded in the Hebrides and  the North East of Scotland, with others in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London. The material explored current forms of self-organised production in rural Scotland, the relationship of these to law and nature, and the various localised, often informal, forms of  governance and social structure within which these exist. In particular, the project focused on the parallels between the experiences modern-day migrant workers in these areas and the impacts of migration and economic restructuring that many of these areas have experienced in the past.</p><p>A version of the film footage combined with transcripts of the interviews was presented as part of the exhibition <i>Fields, Factories and Workshop</i>,  at the CCA: Center for Contemporary Arts, Glasgow, in August and  September 2010. The film version was accompanied by music by <a href="http://www.hannatuulikki.org/">Hanna Tuulikki</a>, a set of vocal works composed from fragments of songs gathered  from people in the locations where the interviews were made.</p>

<p>A book edition of the interview material from Stackwalker was published in 2012 by CCA:Glasgow, entitled <i>Stackwalker: Interviews 2008-2010</i> (ISBN: 9 780956 271389) and distributed by Cornerhouse Publications.</p><p>The subject matter unfolds from the bottom up, one interview leading to the contacts that became the basis for later interviews. Over the course of this process, the perspectives of the people speaking changes. Initially, more first-hand personal experiences were collected. As a whole, the interviews do not present a portrait of any one particular group of people, but rather are a complex of statements, offering many aspects of a process that is not easily bounded in terms of specific identities, periods, or contexts.</p><p>Print copies can be ordered from <a href="https://www.cornerhousepublications.org/publications/stackwalker-interviews-2008-2010/"><b>Cornerhouse Publications</b></a>.</p>

<p>A series of walks exploring the idea of the commons as it is understood and experienced today based around commons areas in Kinson, Townsend and West Howe in Bournemouth. These included an ancient historical commons that was the inspiration for Thomas Hardy, a new reclaimed commons woodland and the public green spaces of a council estate. The walks used photography and sound recording as a way of capturing and presenting responses to the areas and ideas of the project.</p>

<p><i>Given To The People</i> is a film about the Pollok Free State. The Free State was initiated by the actions of a local resident, Colin Macleod, who began a tree top protest against the building a motorway through public woodlands in Pollok, Glasgow, in the early 1990s. Over several years this grew into a series of camps across the Pollok estate. The Free State sought not only to block an unwanted motorway cutting through one of Europe&#x27;s largest inner city public commons, land that had been gifted to the people of Glasgow, but also raised issues over the rights of local people to determine the use and development of public space.</p><p>The film brings together interviews with a number of the participants and an archive of photographic material from the campaign. It was made with the support of the <a href="https://www.galgael.org/">GalGael</a>, an organization that grew out of the Free State, and features music specially composed for the film by <a href="https://gargleblastrecords.bandcamp.com/album/this-is-what-makes-us">Foxface</a>.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/4x9-Wzzkp1w">Watch the film online.</a></p>
